				Challenge 03:<br>
				The Grinch wants to ruin Christmas
			</a>
		</h1>

		<p>
			The Grinch is on the loose and wants to screw up Christmas! 😱 Let's
			fix the mess he's made in Santa's gift factory.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			The Grinch is opening the letters that were going to Santa and
			leaving them in a mess. 😱
		</p>

		<p>
			The letters are a string of text including gifts and parentheses
			<code>()</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To know if a letter is valid ✅, you must check that the parentheses
			close correctly and also that they are not empty.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>But watch out!</strong> Because the Grinch has left braces <code>{</code> and square
			brackets <code>[</code> inside the parentheses that <strong>make them invalid</strong>.
			Luckily he has only left them in the middle of the parentheses...
		</p>

		<p>
			Examples:
		</p>

		<code>
			"bike car (ball) bike car toy"; // -> ✅
			"(doll) console bike"; // ✅

			"bike car (ball bike car"; // -> ❌
			"toy (bike [car) bike car ball"; // -> ❌
			"(toy {) bike"; // -> ❌
			"() bike"; // ❌
		</code>

		<p>
			Create a function that, by passing it the text of the letter,
			returns <code>true</code> if it is valid and <code>false</code> if it is not. And put an
			end to the Grinch's mischief!
		</p>

		<h2>
			Complete the challenge
		</h2>

		<code>
			export default function isValid(letter) {
				// Don't let the Grinch win!
				return true;
			}
		</code>
