				Challenge 08:<br>
				The cryptocurrency craze
			</a>
		</h1>

		<p>
			We have invested in cryptocurrencies... And the other day all the
			stocks went into the red. Instead of panicking, let's see if we can
			optimize new investments.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			Investing in cryptocurrencies is almost a risky sport. The other day
			Bitmart was hacked and has caused the value of Bitcoin, and other
			currencies, to drop by 25%.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are going to write a function that receives the price list of a
			cryptocurrency in a day and we should return the maximum profit we
			could make if we buy and sell the investment on the same day.
		</p>

		<p>
			The price list is an array of numbers and represents time from left
			to right. So keep in mind that <strong>you cannot buy at a price that is
			to the right of sell and you cannot sell at a price that is to the
			left of buy.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			For example:
		</p>

		<code>
				const pricesBtc = [39, 18, 29, 25, 34, 32, 5]
				maxProfit(pricesBtc) // -> 16 (buy at 18, sell at 34)

				const pricesEth = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]  
				maxProfit(pricesEth) // -> 60 (buys at 10, sells at 70)
		</code>

		<p>
			<strong>If no profit can be made that day,</strong> we have to return '-1' to
			prevent us from doing something crazy:
		</p>

		<code>
				const pricesDoge = [18, 15, 12, 12, 11, 9, 7]
				maxProfit(pricesDoge) = // -> -1 (no profit possible)

				const pricesAda = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
				maxProfit(pricesAda) = // -> -1 (no profit possible)
		</code>

		<h2>
			Complete the challenge
		</h2>

		<code>
				export default function maxProfit(prices) {
					// And don't forget to share your solution on networks!
					return false
				}
		</code>
