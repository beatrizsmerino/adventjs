				Challenge 07:<br>
				Searching the store
			</a>
		</h1>

		<p>
			We have a friend who works in a shop and he is not able to find the
			products he has in stock... Can we help him?
		</p>

		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			My friend Dani is working in a shop and with the arrival of
			Christmas the warehouse is a mess and he can't find anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are going to create a <code>contains</code> function that receives two
			parameters: an object that defines the store and the product we are
			looking for.
		</p>

		<p>
			The function must return a boolean that indicates if the string is
			found as a value at some level of the object. Let's see some
			examples:
		</p>

		<code>
			const store1 = {
				shelf1: {
					box1: {
						product1: 'coca-cola',
						product2: 'fanta',
						product3: 'sprite'
					},
				},
				shelf2: {
					box1: 'empty',
					box2: {
						product1: 'trousers',
						product2: 't-shirt' // <- It's here!
					},
				},
			};

			contains(store1, 't-shirt'); // true

			const store2 = {
				boot: {
					bottom: {
						'object': 'cd-rom',
						'other-object': 'diskette',
						'other-think': 'remote control'
					},
				},
			};

			contains(store2, 'gameboy'); // false
		</code>

		<p>
			Keep in mind that the shop is huge. It has different warehouses and,
			as you have seen in the examples, each one can have different
			organisations, <strong>the important thing is to look for that the product
			is in the warehouses</strong>.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Complete the challenge
		</h2>

		<code>
			export default function contains(store, product) {
				// And don't forget to share your solution on social media!
				
				return false
			}
		</code>
