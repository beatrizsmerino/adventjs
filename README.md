## 25 days of JavaScript challenges

### What is an Advent?

Although it has its roots in the Catholic religion, Advent has become a tradition where children get chocolate for 4 weeks, one per day, from December 1st to 24th.

### Every day a new challenge!

Starting on December 1st and until December 25th, every day, a new challenge for you to solve with JavaScript. Compete with your friends!
