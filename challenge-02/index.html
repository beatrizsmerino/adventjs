				Challenge 02:<br>
				Help the elf to list the gifts!
			</a>
		</h1>

		<p>
			What a mess 😵! An elf is helping Santa Claus. He thought it would
			come to him already ordered from each gift how many units he should
			get... and he got a letter ✉️ Help him out!
		</p>

		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			You have received a letter ✉️ with all the gifts you have to
			prepare. The thing is that it is a text string and it is very
			difficult to read 😱. Thank goodness they have put each gift
			separated by space! (although <strong>be careful</strong>, because
			being children, maybe they have put more spaces than necessary).
		</p>

		<p>
			On top of that we noticed that some words come with a <code>_</code> in front
			of the word, for example <code>_playstation</code>, which means
			<strong>it's crossed out and doesn't have to be counted</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Transform the text to an object containing the name of each gift and
			the times it appears. For example, if we have the text:
		</p>

		<code>
				const letter = "bike car ball _playstation bike car toy";
		</code>

		<p>
			When the method is executed it should return the following:
		</p>

		<code>
				const gifts = listGifts(letter);

				console.log(gifts);
				/*
				{
					bike: 2,
					car: 2,
					ball: 1,
					toy: 1
				}
				*/
		</code>

		<p>
			Please note that the tests may be more comprehensive... 😝
			<strong>Be careful with counting blanks!</strong>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Complete the challenge
		</h2>

		<code>
				export default function listGifts(letter) {
					// You can do it!
					return {};
				}
		</code>
