				Challenge 04:<br />
				It's time to put Christmas in the house
			</a>
		</h1>

		<p>
			I think we can bring out the Christmas hat, the nougat... And the
			Christmas tree! ðŸŽ„ Let's set it up with JavaScript.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Description
		</h2>

		<p>
			It's time to put up the Christmas tree at home! ðŸŽ„
		</p>

		<p>
			To do this, we are going to create a function that receives the
			height of the tree, which will be a positive integer from 1 to, at
			most, 100.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we pass it the argument '5', it would paint this:
		</p>

		<em>
			<pre>
				____*____
				___***___
				__*****__
				_*******_
				*********
				____#____
				____#____
			</pre>
		</em>

		<p>
			We create a triangle of asterisks '*' with the proportionate height
			and, on the sides, we use the underscore '_' for the spaces. It is
			very important that our tree always has the same length on each
			side.
		</p>

		<p>
			All trees, no matter how small or large, have a trunk of two '#'
			lines.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another example with a tree of height '3':
		</p>

		<em>
			<pre>
				__*__
				_***_
				*****
				__#__
				__#__
			</pre>
		</em>

		<p>
			Note that the tree is a string and you need the line breaks '/n' for
			each line to form the tree properly.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Complete the challenge

		<em>
			<pre>
				export default function createXmasTree(height) {
					// And don't forget to put the nougats in too!
					return "";
				}
			</pre>
		</em>
